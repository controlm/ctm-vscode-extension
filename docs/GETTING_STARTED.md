## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Open the Getting Started Walkthrough

#### 3. Enter API Token
- Your API token is stored securely using VS Code's SecretStorage
- Never stored in plain text

**How to Get an API Token:**

If you have the Control-M CLI installed:
```bash
# Login to generate a token
ctm session login -e https://ctm-em.yourcompany.com:8443/automation-api

# View your current session
ctm session list
```

Contact your Control-M administrator if you need help obtaining a token.
